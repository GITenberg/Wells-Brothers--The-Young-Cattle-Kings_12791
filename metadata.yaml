description: 'In the Old West, family fortunes were often made -- and sometimes lost
  -- with amazing rapidity. In Andy Adams'' novel Wells Brothers: The Young Cattle
  Kings, a pair of orphaned brothers put their scrappy determination to work and establish
  a thriving ranch in an extremely inhospitable environment with tall odds stacked
  against them. Praised for its realism, Wells Brothers is a must-read for those interested
  in well-researched fiction about the West.'
